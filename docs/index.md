## Getting started

<!-- The [Bloader Template] provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Bloader theme. To get started with creating a site, just click "[use the template]"! -->

{: .note }
To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Bloader repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Bloader.

You can easily set the site created by the template to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [template README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

<!-- If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^2] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages. -->

More specifically, the created site:

<!-- - uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages -->

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with the template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

{: .note }
See [README][Bloader README] for a brief documentation.

## Future implementations 
- Change from BoltDB to a database that is still supported today
- Add external cloud providers, etc. to Override's Type.
- Add functionality for performing analysis.
- Make it run as a server and make it visually clear besides the CLI.
- Introduce original Encrypt between Master and Slave.
- Add gRPC as a measurement target.
- Addition of test code 
- Add plugin functionality.
